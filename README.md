# Social-Justice-Hackathon

Won first place in HackRU for creating an application that takes data and creates a heat map of all of the columns containing data on air pollution, poverty ect. You could overlay the data and find any correlations with the data points. 

We are also currently adding the prediction component in order to give a prediction for the next year.
